                <h1>What is the sheaf of <i>meromorphic \(p\)-forms</i> \(\Omega_X^k(*D)\)?</h1>

                </p>     
                <p>
                    I was recently reading about <i>Grothendieck's Algebraic de Rham Theorem</i>  in Griffiths and Harris, page 453, which states that, for \(X\) a complex manifold and \(D\) a simple normal crossing divisor on \(X\), the complex cohomology of \(U:= X\setminus D\) can be computed as 
                    $$H^k(U;\mathbb{C}) = \mathbb{H}^k (X,\Omega_X^\bullet(\log(D))),$$
                    i.e. it is the hypercohomology of the so called <i>logarithmic de Rham complex</i> \(\Omega_X^\bullet(\log(D))\) of sheaves on \(X\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a complex of sheaves whose $p$-th term is the sheaf $\Omega_X^p (\log(D))$, which in turn is defined as the subsheaf of the sheaf $\Omega_X^i(*D)$ of <i>meromorphic $p$-forms that are holomorphic on $X\setminus D$</i>. Then $\Omega_X^1 (\log(D))$ is stated to be locally free, and [PT08] gives the description, for $p\in D$ and $(V,z_1,\dots,z_n)$ on $X$ containing $p$ such that $D$ has equation $z_1\dots z_k =0$, that $$\Omega_X^1(\log(D))_p=\mathcal{O}_{X,p}\frac{dz_1}{z_1}\oplus \dots \oplus \mathcal{O}_{X,p}\frac{dz_k}{z_k} \oplus \mathcal{O}_{X,p}dz_{k+1}\oplus \dots \oplus \mathcal{O}_{X,p}dz_{n}.$$
                    Then the sheaf $\Omega_X^q (\log (D))$ is defined to be the $p$-th wedge $\bigwedge^q \Omega_X^1 (\log (D))$.
                    While one can have a certain intuition about what this sheaf is, I find it unclear what relation it has to the sheaf $\Omega_X^i(*D)$. On page 135 of [GH], there is a definition of a meromorphic section of a line bundle, and it would be tempting to define meromorphic forms as such sections of $\Omega_X^p$, but this is not exactly what we want as $\Omega_X^p$ is not a line bundle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chasing through the literature, Deligne uses the complex  \(\Omega_X^\bullet(\log(D))\) in the [Hodge 1] paper to define a mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of $U$, and cites [Del70, Section II.3.1-7] for proofs. Going there however, the definition of meromorphic sections given on page 66 is also quite cryptic. Going back to what I believe is the original source of the theorem by Grothendieck [Gr66, p. 97], we find a completely satisfactory definition in a footnote (which is, in retrospect, the one given by Deligne).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reproduce the definition here, and encourage the reader to refer back to the original paper, where the statement is given in terms of complex analytic spaces.
                    <blockquote>
                        <b>Definition [Gr66,p. 97]</b>
                    <p>
                        Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $U$. Suppose that $\mathscr{F}$ on $U$ can be extended, on an open neighbourhood $W_y$ in $X$ of any point $y\in D$, into a coherent sheaf $\mathscr{G}$.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then the <i>sheaf $\mathscr{F}(*D)$ of meromorphic sections of $\mathscr{F}$ that are holomorphic on $U$</i> is the subsheaf of $f_*(\mathscr{F})$ whose sections on an open set $V$, are the sections $\omega$ of $\mathscr{F}$ on $V\cap U$ such that, for every $y\in V\cap D$, there exists an open neighbourhood $W\subset W_y \cap V$ of $y$, a section $\omega'$ of $\mathscr{G}$, and an integer $n$, such that $\omega|_{W\cap U} = (\omega'/(\phi')^n)|_{W\cap U}$, where $\omega'$ is the defining equation of $Y$ in $X$.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can be checked that these $\omega$ indeed are the sections of a subsheaf $\mathscr{F}(*D)$ of $f_* (\mathscr{F})$, and that this subsheaf does not depend on the choices performed.
                    </p>
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is stated that when $\mathscr{F}$ can be extended globally to a coherent sheaf $\mathscr{G}$ on $X$, there is a natural isomorphism $$\mathscr{F}(*D)\cong {\lim_{\longrightarrow}} \mathscr{Hom}_{\mathscr{O}_X}(\mathscr{I}^n, \mathscr{G}),$$
                    where $\mathscr{I}$ is a coherent sheaf of ideals on $X$ defining $D$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then finally, in the case of the sheaf of holomorphic $p$-forms $\Omega_U^p$ on $U$, one can take $\mathscr{G}=\Omega_X^p$. This gives a complete definition of what the sheaf $\Omega_X^p (*D)$ is.
